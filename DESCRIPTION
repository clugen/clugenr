Description: An implementation of the clugen algorithm for generating
    multidimensional clusters with arbitrary distributions. Each cluster is
    supported by a line segment, the position, orientation and length of which
    guide where the respective points are placed. This package is described in
    Fachada & de Andrade (2023) <doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2023.110836>.
