#' Generate multidimensional clusters
#'
#' @description
#' \loadmathjax
#' This is the main function of **clugenr**, and possibly the only function most
#' users will need.
#'
#' @details
#' If a custom function was given in the `clusizes_fn` parameter, it is
#' possible that `num_points` may have a different value than what was
#' specified in the `num_points` parameter.
#'
#' The terms "average" and "dispersion" refer to measures of central
#' tendency and statistical dispersion, respectively. Their exact meaning
#' depends on the optional arguments.
#'
#' @note This function is stochastic. For reproducibility set a PRNG seed with
#' [set.seed].
#'
#' @param num_dims Number of dimensions.
#' @param num_clusters Number of clusters to generate.
#' @param num_points Total number of points to generate.
#' @param direction Average direction of the cluster-supporting lines (vector of
#' length `num_dims`).
#' @param angle_disp Angle dispersion of cluster-supporting lines (radians).
#' @param cluster_sep Average cluster separation in each dimension (vector of
#' length `num_dims`).
#' @param llength Average length of cluster-supporting lines.
#' @param llength_disp Length dispersion of cluster-supporting lines.
#' @param lateral_disp Cluster lateral dispersion, i.e., dispersion of points
#' from their projection on the cluster-supporting line.
#' @param allow_empty Allow empty clusters? `FALSE` by default.
#' @param cluster_offset Offset to add to all cluster centers (vector of length
#' `num_dims`). By default there will be no offset.
#' @param proj_dist_fn Distribution of point projections along
#' cluster-supporting lines, with three possible values:
#' - `"norm"` (default): Distribute point projections along lines using a normal
#'   distribution (\mjeqn{\mu=}{μ=} _line_center_,
#'   \mjeqn{\sigma=}{σ=} `llength/6` ).
#' - `"unif"`: Distribute points uniformly along the line.
#' - User-defined function, which accepts two parameters, line length (`double`)
#'   and number of points (`integer`), and returns a vector containing the
#'   distance of each point projection to the center of the line. For example,
#'   the `"norm"` option roughly corresponds to
#'   `function(l, n) stats::rnorm(n, sd = l / 6)`.
#' @param point_dist_fn Controls how the final points are created from their
#' projections on the cluster-supporting lines, with three possible values:
#' - `"n-1"` (default): Final points are placed on a hyperplane orthogonal to
#'   the cluster-supporting line, centered at each point's projection, using the
#'   normal distribution (\mjeqn{\mu=0}{μ=0},
#'   \mjeqn{\sigma=}{σ=} `lateral_disp` ). This is done by the [clupoints_n_1]
#'   function.
#' - `"n"`: Final points are placed around their projection on the
#'   cluster-supporting line using the normal distribution (\mjeqn{\mu=0}{μ=0},
#'   \mjeqn{\sigma=}{σ=} `lateral_disp` ). This is done by the [clupoints_n]
#'   function.
#' - User-defined function: The user can specify a custom point placement
#'   strategy by passing a function with the same signature as [clupoints_n_1]
#'   and [clupoints_n].
#' @param clusizes_fn Distribution of cluster sizes. By default, cluster sizes
#' are determined by the [clusizes] function, which uses the normal distribution
#' (\mjeqn{\mu=}{μ=} `num_points`/`num_clusters`, \mjeqn{\sigma=\mu/3}{σ=μ/3}),
#' and assures that the final cluster sizes add up to `num_points`. This
#' parameter allows the user to specify a custom function for this purpose,
#' which must follow [clusizes] signature. Note that custom functions are not
#' required to strictly obey the `num_points` parameter.
#' @param clucenters_fn Distribution of cluster centers. By default, cluster
#' centers are determined by the [clucenters] function, which uses the uniform
#' distribution, and takes into account the `num_clusters` and `cluster_sep`
#' parameters for generating well-distributed cluster centers. This parameter
#' allows the user to specify a custom function for this purpose, which must
#' follow [clucenters] signature.
#' @param llengths_fn Distribution of line lengths. By default, the lengths of
#' cluster-supporting lines are determined by the [llengths] function, which
#' uses the folded normal distribution (\mjeqn{\mu=}{μ=} `llength`,
#' \mjeqn{\sigma=}{σ=} `llength_disp` ). This parameter allows the user to
#' specify a custom function for this purpose, which must follow [llengths]
#' signature.
#' @param angle_deltas_fn Distribution of line angle differences with respect to
#' `direction`. By default, the angles between `direction` and the direction of
#' cluster-supporting lines are determined by the [angle_deltas] function, which
#' uses the wrapped normal distribution (\mjeqn{\mu=0}{μ=0},
#' \mjeqn{\sigma=}{σ=} `angle_disp` ) with support in the interval
#' \mjeqn{\left[-\pi/2,\pi/2\right]}{[-π/2, π/2]}. This parameter allows the
#' user to specify a custom function for this purpose, which must follow
#' [angle_deltas] signature.
#' @param seed An integer used to initialize the PRNG, allowing for reproducible
#' results. If specified, `seed` is simply passed to [set.seed].
#' @return A named list with the following elements:
#' - `points`: A `num_points` x `num_dims` matrix with the generated points for
#'   all clusters.
#' - `clusters`: A `num_points` factor vector indicating which cluster
#'    each point in `points` belongs to.
#' - `projections`: A `num_points` x `num_dims` matrix with the point
#'   projections on the cluster-supporting lines.
#' - `sizes`: A `num_clusters` x 1 vector with the number of points in
#'   each cluster.
#' - `centers`: A `num_clusters` x `num_dims` matrix with the
#'   coordinates of the cluster centers.
#' - `directions`: A `num_clusters` x `num_dims` matrix with the
#'   direction of each cluster-supporting line.
#' - `angles`: A `num_clusters` x 1 vector with the angles between the
#'   cluster-supporting lines and the main direction.
#' - `lengths`: A `num_clusters` x 1 vector with the lengths of the
#'   cluster-supporting lines.
